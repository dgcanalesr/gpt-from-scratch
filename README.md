# gpt-from-scratch
Implementation of a light version of GPT from scratch, following [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) by Andrej Karpathy.

I developed this implementation to get a deeper understanding about the attention mechanism and how GPT works.

The models are trained with the [Tiny Sheakespeare Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt) for character-level text generation.
